    <h1>The Super Sketchy Mario/Seriously Sketchy Material Website</h1>

    <h2>What is it about?</h2>
    <p>
      This website will have Super Sketchy Mario comics and other art that I
      have posted. Ideally, I would like to have every comic and all art
      (including drawings posted exclusively on twitter), but, considering there
      are over 200 Super Sketchy Mario comics, I probably won't have them all on
      here for a while.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
      This website is meant to bring all of my projects under SSM together into
      one place. Before this site, if you wanted to see everything I have made
      you would have to go to two Deviantart pages and a twitter page, but now
      it's all on this one website with a much simpler way to navigate between
      the comics and the art.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <p>
      This website is mainly for fans of my work who want to browse everything
      that I have made in a more convenient way. Since SSM has been and always
      will be a passion project, this page is not necessarily meant to draw in
      new readers. As for SSM itself, it's targeted towards fans of video games.
      Mario and other Nintendo properties are the main focus, but I do branch
      out into other games like Toontown, A Hat in Time, and Team Fortress 2.
      Additionally, I do like to make my own stories, characters, and worlds,
      but that's not really what people read Super Sketchy Mario for.
    </p>

    <h2>What is going to be on each page?</h2>
    <p>
      Homepage: This page will have the logo and buttons that go to the comic
      and art directories and the feedback page. It will have some quick links
      to different comics and art like the latest comic, latest drawing,
      Friendart of the Month, and the first comic so people can start reading
      from the beginning. I'd also like to include a poll somewhere on the page
      for some comic-related feedback. Questions would be along the lines of
      "Who is your favorite character?" with about 5 different characters to
      choose from. More specific feedback is meant to be given on the feedback
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comic Directory: This page will be a list of every comic that is currently
      on the website in order of comic number. I would like to add a few bells
      and whistles to make finding comics easier. These would include: small
      thumbnail images for each comic, buttons to filter by series/subseries,
      and sorting options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comic Content Page: Every comic will have its own dedicated page that
      follow a similar format. Each content page will have the comic's title,
      the comic itself, unique Brawl in the Family style mouse-over text, a
      description, a button to go back to the comic directory, and buttons to go
      to other comics. The buttons will bring readers to: the first comic, the
      previous comic, the next comic, and the latest comic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art Directory: This page will be very similar to the comic directory, but
      it will just show art pieces. My art pieces are not numbered, so I would
      like to put them in a grid view rather than a list. The art would be split
      up into different sections including main-series art, friendart, and style
      switch-ups. Since I have significantly less art pieces than I do comics, I
      would like to give each art piece a preview image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art Content Page: Following the same theme as the directory page, this
      page will also be similar to the comic content page. I don't think these
      pages would undergo a large rework like the directory page did, but will
      moreso be a watered down comic content page since the art pieces don't
      have as much going on as the comics. These pages will still have the
      title, drawing, and description, but will not have mouse-over text nor an
      intricate button system like the comic page had since my drawings are more
      self-contained There will still be buttons to go to other drawings, but it
      will likely just be next and previous buttons. I would like to give these
      buttons thumbnails for the next drawing so that readers know what drawing
      they will be going to. Each page will also have a "back to directory"
      button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feedback Page: I'd like to collect all kinds of feedback on this page with
      a focus on criticism. The poll from the home page will be there alonside a
      dedicated feedback form. The form will have an option to specify which
      series the feedback is aimed at. There will be a small message above the
      feedback form where I politely ask for criticism. Additionally, I could
      include another poll-like question to be answered in the feedback form and
      past poll questions with results.
