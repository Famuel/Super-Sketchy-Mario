    <h3>
      Super Sketchy Mario is a video game based, comedic, webcomic focused on
      the worlds of many different video game franchises (with heavy influences
      from <a href="http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/">Brawl in the Family</a>). While the namesake of the comic and the most
      common characters you'll be seeing are Mario characters, many other
      franchises both big and small are represented here. If you're a fan of A
      Hat in Time, Tomodachi Life, and Toontown among others, then I'm sure
      you'll find something to enjoy here. If you're looking for something new,
      the I've got you covered. SSM has no shortage of strange made-up
      characters including the strange trio of Personalities, treasure hunter
      Jones of the Mushroom Kingdom, and the straight-man and funny-guy duo of
      Westhaven: Hannah and Derrick. Weird things happen every day in this
      strange comic world. Maybe a samurai king is trying to learn about Italy,
      a purple-clad tennis master is making his home in a bush, or a haunted
      robot is making sandwiches that no reasonable person would touch. It's a
      peck of a time that I hope you'll stick around for!

      Upload Schedule: I try to upload new comics here and on <a href="https://supersketchymario.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a>
       every weekend, usually in the early to mid-afternoon.
      <br />
      <br />
      This website is also home to SSM Art, a collection of various drawings I
      have either made myself, or some of my amazingly talented friends have
      made for me (uploaded with their permission, of course). Unlike Super
      Sketchy Mario, these drawing have no set upload schedule and more or less
      come out when I feel like it. Check those out under the Art section!

      What to learn more about the strange cast of Super Sketchy Mario? Me too,
      but bios are still in development. They will be coming soon, I promise.
