    <h1>SSM 221 - Hot Tub</h1>
    <h3>
      Remember when Mario and Luigi got a nice massage from some jellyfish?
      Yeah, me too. The bros. being in a perfectly relaxed state seems to let
      their hand powers run wild. Mario should have remembered that before
      letting Luigi into a hot tub, huh. Eh, I'm sure they'll be fine.
      <br />
      <br />
      Well, that was a nice comic description: short, sweet, and to the point.
      Too bad I have stuff to say. Happy October, everyone, except for you Mario
      and Luigi fans out there. Yeah, it's been a year since our favorite Mario
      RPG developer went under, and I still think about it to this day. But, I
      never like to keep a day as a sad one (after all, October 5th and 6th both
      are the release dates of my favorite games, so I'm not gonna let
      AlphaDream's bankruptcy ruin early October for me). Until Mario and Luigi
      escape limbo, I will be making October into a sort of "Mario and Luigi
      Month." It's not like an official thing that I'm going to make a big deal
      about, so you can just expect this month's uploads to all be themed around
      the Mario and Luigi series. I'll even try to make the Halloween comic
      follow that same theme. I hope you enjoy this little extra celebration of
      the brothers!
