    <h1>Princess Luigi</h1>
    <h3>
      Based on that one panel from the Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga + Bowser's
      Minions review. The moment in Superstar Saga when the bros trick Bowletta
      and Fawful into thinking Luigi is Peach is my absolute favorite moment in
      video games, and it only got better with the remake! I absolutely love the
      addition of the paint cans in the remake because it really makes sense:
      Luigi is shorter than Peach so he'd need something to make him look
      taller. I guess since I brought up that review comic I can finally say
      that, after some thought, it doesn't reflect my real opinion on the game.
      Honestly, I'd give it a 12/10 as opposed to the original 13/10. I might
      talk about why in the future, but now's not the future (I mean, you are
      seeing this after I post it... so...).
