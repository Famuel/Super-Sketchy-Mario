    <h1>Friendart by Jess - Sarah Sketch</h1>
    <h3>
      I'm just gonna put this out there: Jess' artstyle is my absolute favorite
      artstyle! She does such an amazing job even with simple sketches! She also
      will be uploading her own comics at some point in the future and when that
      happens I will be advertising the heck out of it because her work is just
      amazing! This sketch was the first thing she drew for me and I still pick
      it up every once in a while to admire it! Funnily enough, if I'm
      remembering this correctly, she drew this the first day that we started
      hanging out.
