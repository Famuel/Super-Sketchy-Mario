    <h3>
      Yep. That's Sarah and it definitely makes me feel uncomfortable when I
      remember that Sarah is me. However, that doesn't take anything away for
      how amazing this is! I mean really! Just look at how well she used
      watercolors to make this look incredible (it's a shame my scanner can't
      present this in it's full glory)! Jess drew this for me based on me
      apparently saying I wanted Sarah to really look like a girl. I assume I
      meant anatomy-wise, but she took it as clothing-wise. It was actually
      pretty funny because the day she gave this to me I was going to tell her
      that I wanted to give her full control over drawing Sarah however she
      wanted.
