    <h1>Friendart by Joseph - Another Sarah Sketch</h1>
    <h3>
      For some reason my friends really like drawing Sarah. Like, really, half
      of the friendart I currently have is of Sarah or involves Sarah in some
      way. I do really like Joseph's style (although not as much as Jess'. Sorry
      Jobo), and he did a really good job with this drawing! My only issue is
      the "S" on the hat, but I don't blame him for that at all. The "C" on my
      hat makes no sense because it refers to something from back when I first
      drew Steve.
